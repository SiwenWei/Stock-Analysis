In this portfolio project I look at data from the stock market, particularly some Canadian oil stocks. I learn how to use pandas to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally look at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. I also predict future stock prices through a Monte Carlo method.
